\section{Synopsis}
C++ 17 library providing functionality related to trigonometry.
The library is made available publicly on
\href{\GetLibraryRepository}{Github}
under the
\href{\GetLibraryRepository/blob/master/LICENSE}{MIT License}.

\chapter{Requirements}
If the library is added to a project, then one needs to add Primordial Machine libraries
\href{https://github.com/primordialmachine/one-zero-functors}{One Zero Functors Library}
as well.

\chapter{Limitations and Restrictions}
The library officially only supports Visual Studio 2017 and Windows 10.
%The library provides support for floating point types i.e. types which are provided by the C++ language.
%However, as a proof of concept of the abstractions, fixed point and arbitrary precision implementations need to be added to the library.

%\section{Introductory example}
%Examples are located in the \href{\GetLibraryRepository/blob/master/examples}{examples} directory.

\chapter{Building under Visual Studio 2017}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Open the solution \texttt{solution.sln} in Microsoft Visual Studio 2017.
\item Batch build everything.
\item The folder \texttt{packages} contains the distribution of the library i.e. include files and the
      static libraries for
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item the platforms \texttt{Win32} and \texttt{x64} and
    \item configurations \texttt{Release} and \texttt{Debug}.
  \end{enumerate}
\item Copy the contents of the \verb+packages+ folder into a directory. Let
      \verb+[library home]+ be a placeholder denoting the path by which that folder
      can be referenced from your project.
\item Add
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item the include path
\begin{verbatim}
[library home]/primordialmachine/trigonometry/
$(PlatformTarget.toLower())/$(Configuration.toLower())/includes
\end{verbatim}
	and
    \item the library path
\begin{verbatim}
[library home]/primordialmachine/trigonometry/
$(PlatformTarget.toLower())/$(Configuration.toLower())/libraries
\end{verbatim}
    to your project.
\end{enumerate}
\item Link your project with the library \verb+trigonometry.lib+.
\item Add the include directive \verb+#include "primordialmachine/trigonometry/include.hpp"+ where appropriate.
\item You can now use the functionality provided by the library.
\end{enumerate}

\section{\textit{concept NullaryFunctor}}
A \textit{NullaryFunctor} is a function object with two template arguments \texttt{RESULT} and
\texttt{ENABLED}. Specializations of this type must provide a constant \verb+operator()+ with
zero parameters. The return value of that operand is a value of type \texttt{RESULT} (or constant
reference to a value of that type).\\

\section{\textit{concept UnaryFunctor}}
A \textit{NullaryFunctor} is a function object with three template arguments \texttt{RESULT},

that). The return value of that operand is a value of type \texttt{RESULT} (or constant
reference to a value of that type).\\

\noindent{}The default type of \verb+ENABLED+ is \verb+void+. Specializations of this type may use
the \verb+ENABLED+ argument to perform \textit{SFINAE}.\\
